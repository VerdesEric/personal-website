        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Gen Z isn’t turning to cable news—they’re tuning into <b>political podcasts</b> while walking, commuting, or working out. These shows feel personal and authentic, but that intimacy <b>can mask misinformation</b>. In a space where opinion and fact blur easily and multitasking is the norm, critical thinking often happens after the episode ends.</p>
        <p>Our project explored how Gen Z engages with political podcasts, how they build trust, and what prompts reflection or skepticism. Using diary studies and cultural probes, we uncovered that trust is shaped more by transparency than neutrality—and that the podcast ecosystem lacks tools to support informed, reflective listening. This research laid the foundation for designing solutions that promote media literacy in today’s decentralized media environment.</p>
        <h3>The Challenge</h3>
        <p class="inline">How might we design a solution that helps Gen Z critically engage with political podcasts without disrupting the authentic, immersive experience they value?</p>
        <p>The Credibility Companion was born from a challenge we observed in Gen Z’s media habits: the tension between emotionally engaging content and the lack of tools to assess credibility in real time. Podcasts foster trust through personality and storytelling, but often blur fact and opinion. We saw this as an <b>opportunity</b> to design an intervention that strengthens <b>critical reflection without compromising the listening experience</b>.</p>
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p><b>A post-listening credibility tool for political podcast consumers</b>. The Credibility Companion introduces fact-check summaries, community-driven credibility notes, and hands-free audio prompts—allowing Gen Z listeners to reflect on political content after listening, while preserving the authenticity and flow of the podcast experience.</p>
        <h3>Literature Review & Background</h3>
        <p>Gen Z’s turn to political podcasts creates new trust and misinformation challenges. Existing research on emotional engagement, trust formation, and media habits shaped our understanding of the problem.</p>

            <h3>User research</h3>
            <p>We conducted initial contextual interviews with Gen Z podcast listeners to explore how they <b>engage</b> with political content, build trust, and navigate potential misinformation.</p>
            <p>User interviews revealed that Gen Z values <b>accessible, simplified political news</b> but struggles with misinformation, bias, and emotionally charged content; fact-checking habits varied, highlighting a need for tools that support post-listening reflection and credibility assessment. User interviews led to the development of the following user profiles.</p>
