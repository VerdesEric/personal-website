        <h3>What it is</h3>
        <p>Room Vision is an interactive design solution that combines modular furniture with a digital platform tailored for <b>busy college students</b>. Designed with functionality, personalization, and sustainability in mind, the system includes an <b>AR-enhanced</b> mobile app with <b>AI-driven</b> suggestions and a <b>collaborative community feed</b>. Room Vision empowers students to personalize their living spaces <b>efficiently</b>—even with limited time and space—without compromising on comfort or aesthetics.</p>
        <h3>Design Challenge</h3>
        <p class="inline">How might we help college students personalize small living spaces in a way that balances aesthetics, comfort, and practical constraints—despite time pressures and space limitations?</p>
        <p>Inspired by the real needs of student life, we tackled the everyday problem of <b>functional, comfortable design inspiration</b> in limited campus housing. Room Vision addresses this by providing a flexible system of <b>eco-friendly modular furniture</b> paired with a <b>digital interface</b> that not only guides users through their room design journey but also serves as a source of inspiration—helping students discover, explore, and implement creative design decisions that suit their <b>space and lifestyle</b>.</p>
        <h3>The Vision</h3>
        <p>The goal wasn’t just to provide furniture—it was to create a system where digital tools enhance the <b>physical environment</b>. We envisioned a smart assistant for student living: an app that uses augmented reality to visualize layouts, artificial intelligence to suggest personalized styles, and community engagement to promote shared design ideas.</p>
        <p>Room Vision helps transform daily environments into spaces that support student well-being, productivity, and creative self-expression.</p>
        <div class="interviewees">
            <h3>User Research</h3>
            <p>We conducted contextual interviews to understand how students <b>live, decorate, and adapt their spaces</b> in real-world conditions. This method allowed us to observe their <b>habits, constraints, and design behaviors</b> within the context of their daily routines.</p>

                <div class="low-fid-paragraph">
                    <h4>Low-Fidelity Prototype</h4>
                    <p>The first step in the design process was to create a <b>low-fidelity paper prototype</b> modeled after an iPhone to simulate a realistic mobile app experience. Using simple materials like paper, pens, post-its, and transparent sheets, I designed layered screens to represent app interactions.</p>

                    <p>1. <b>Improve visual clarity</b> – The “Scan Room” button was unclear due to design elements like dashed lines.</p>
                    <p>2. <b>Make input fields more visible</b> – The text box in “AI Suggestions” was easy to miss due to poor placement and lack of color.</p>
                    <p>3. <b>Balance function and aesthetics</b> – Users appreciated layout rationale but wanted more focus on visual appeal.</p>
                    <p>4. <b>Ensure design consistency</b> – The “Feed” screen felt disconnected from the rest of the app’s look and flow.</p>

            <div class="mid-fidelity">
                <h4>Mid-Fidelity Prototype</h4>
                <p>The mid-fidelity prototype marked a key step in <b>refining our concept</b>, helping us apply best practices in user interface design and better visualize the final product. Built in Figma, this prototype allowed us to simulate <b>real app navigation</b>, offering a more <b>interactive and structured experience</b> than the paper version. It helped us test layout, flow, and usability in a realistic format, ensuring that each feature—from AR scanning to AI suggestions—was intuitive, functional, and aligned with users’ expectations.</p>

            <h3>Reflection & Takeaways</h3>
            <p>Over the course of the semester, I developed a strong understanding of the <b>UX design process</b> and how each step contributes to creating impactful solutions. From conducting contextual interviews and building personas to developing low-, mid-, and high-fidelity prototypes—both on paper and in Figma—and running usability tests, I learned that cohesive design stems from a <b>thoughtful, iterative process</b> rooted in user needs. I came to understand that success in UX requires a <b>structured approach</b> that prioritizes <b>user insight, ideation, and continuous refinement</b>. Prototyping, in particular, helped reveal design gaps and guided improvements toward a more effective final product.</p>
